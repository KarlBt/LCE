Contributing 
============

There are many ways to contribute to LCE, with the most common ones
being contribution of code or documentation to the project. Improving the
documentation is no less important than improving the library itself. If you
find a typo in the documentation, or have made improvements, do not hesitate to 
submit a GitHub pull request.
Documentation can be found under the
[doc/](https://github.com/LocalCascadeEnsemble/LCE/tree/main/doc) directory.

But there are many other ways to help. In particular answering queries on the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/LocalCascadeEnsemble/LCE/issues),
investigating bugs, and reviewing other developers' pull requests are very valuable contributions.
