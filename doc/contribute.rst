They are multiple ways to participate in LCE; for instance, school projects for students, research questions for academics, performance maximization through collaboration for professionals:

- Add a star to LCE GitHub repository. It seems insignificant but it is key for LCE referencing and visibility
- Answer queries on the issue tracker, investigate bugs, and review other developersâ€™ pull requests to make sure the existing version is running as expected
- Develop new test cases to make the codebase more robust
- Extend LCE capabilities by adding new features (e.g., modeling flexibility, faithful explainability-by-design, GPU support). For more detailed information about new feature ideas, please refer to the article `"LCE: The Most Powerful Machine Learning Method?" <https://towardsdatascience.com/lce-the-most-powerful-machine-learning-method-e8ea77f317d6?source=friends_link&sk=c8911ad03dd1e0e3fd02a17835609737>`_
- Design tutorials in various media outlets, targeting different audiences, to make more people discover LCE

For organizations, it is possible to sponsor the project to cover the expenses needed to develop LCE along with the highest standards (e.g., professional services like a robust continuous integration infrastructure, workshop expenses).
