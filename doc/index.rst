LCE Documentation
====================

**Local Cascade Ensemble (LCE)** is a machine learning method that **further enhances** the prediction performance of the state-of-the-art **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**.
LCE combines their strengths and adopts a complementary diversification approach to obtain a better generalizing predictor.
Specifically, LCE is a hybrid ensemble method that combines an explicit boosting-bagging approach to handle the bias-variance trade-off faced by 
machine learning models and an implicit divide-and-conquer approach to individualize classifier errors on different parts of the training data.
LCE has been evaluated on a public benchmark and published in the journal *Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery*.

LCE package is **compatible with scikit-learn**; it passes the `check_estimator <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.utils.estimator_checks.check_estimator.html#sklearn.utils.estimator_checks.check_estimator>`_.
Therefore, it can interact with scikit-learn pipelines and model selection tools.
